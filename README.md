---

To get started:

1. `git clone https://github.com/bryantheastronaut/boozehound.git`
2. `cd boozehound && npm install`
3. `npm run start` to start the API server. After client is added, running `npm run start:client` will start the API and the client.

Running `mocha test` will run the test suite: see _test/example.js_ for example.
